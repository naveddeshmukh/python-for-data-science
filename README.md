# Python

## Introduction

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation

Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.

Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Its core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.
